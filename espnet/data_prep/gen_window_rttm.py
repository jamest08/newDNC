"""
For each meeting, create a list of windows where the shift between window centres is ~1s.  A sequence of windows
should cover a segment of one or more speakers (ie. a period without silence), aligned to start and
end with the segment boundaries.  To allow this, windows may be slightly less than 1s.
See 'Cosine-Distance Virtual Adversarial Training for Semi-Supervised Speaker-Discriminative
Acoustic Embeddings' Section 3.2 for further details.
Ignore windows with mostly silence.
Speaker label is the label which covers most of the window (if equal, randomise).
Output a new rttm file where each line is one window.  Requires start_index, end_index, speakerlabel
Start and end times correspond to the period for which each point in time is closest to the centre 
of that window, or the start/end of the combined segment.

NB: I know this script is inefficient but it only needs to be run once and makes it clear what's 
happening at each stage and so is easy to edit.
